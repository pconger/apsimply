<div class="col-12 aboutUsText"><div class="aboutUsStop">Thank you for joining us on this journey! We are Abby and Preston Conger - the 'ap' in apSimply.</div>

<div class="aboutUsStop">On our site, we want to share a snapshot of our lives - the decisions we make with our resources, the adventures we take, our walk of faith, and the exercise of our creativity.</div>

<div class="aboutUsStop">We are committed to living a life of simplicity and moderation. This looks like a commitment to reuse, repurpose, and recycle whenever possible. It is a commitment to limit our consumption and make quality purchases instead of always opting for cheap and convenient. It is a commitment to rely on our local community for goods and services as far as possible. It is a commitment to do-it-ourselves before subscribing to a service or buying a pre-made product.</div>

<div class="aboutUsStop">One of the do-it-ourselves projects is the website itself. If you have ever looked into blogging, the subscription services can add up quickly. We were not interested in chaining ourselves to more monthly or annual costs, getting trapped in a system where we didn't have the ultimate say. Preston has slowly been teaching himself to code, set up a self-hosted server, and design a website over the past several months. This blog will be slowly improving and growing as he does-it-himself and we keep our subscription services to a minimum.</div>

<div class="aboutUsStop">We live in the greater Boston area, although we are both transplants, and still struggle to call this home sometimes. Our lifestyle is not the majority lifestyle and so we often find ourselves to be the odd ones out, choosing a home-cooked meal instead of a night on the town or choosing to use second-hand furniture that doesn't necessarily match instead of buying a brand-new set.</div>

<div class="aboutUsStop">Abby grew up in Idaho, spending the summers backpacking in the rugged Sawtooth Mountains and exploring the depths of Hell's Canyon - the deepest gorge in North America. She double-majored in Spanish and Theology and spent a year in Peru working with Fair Trade artisans before pursuing her Masters of Divinity degree. She started a non-profit providing free or low-cost legal services to immigrants and now is getting ready to raise a baby, which is coming in May 2018.</div>

<div class="aboutUsStop">Preston grew up in South Carolina, spending most of his time in the pool. He competed for 4 years in the NCAA Division III while also getting a B.A. in Theology and a B.S. in Biology. He worked in a health clinic following graduation until he moved to New England to pursue his Masters of Divinity and his Masters of Theology degrees. During seminary, he found himself increasingly interested in educational technology and was offered a job in Digital Education soon after graduation. He is now pursing a Masters in Organizational Performance and Workplace Learning through on online program.</div></div>
