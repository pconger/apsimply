  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Wolf's Bane</div><div class="sonnetSeries">I fled from home to hide what I&apos;d become.<br/>
For I&apos;d become a hide of filthy fur,<br/>
a mouth of fearful fangs, a wolf for some,<br/>
a fearsome, horrid phantom all concur.<br/>
So now I scamper, stirring fallen leaves.<br/>
The lonesome moonlight guides me as I trace<br/>
through tree trunk traps and shoulder sheaves<br/>
upon my grizzled back with sore disgrace.<br/>
These sheaves of shame are strapped around me fast.<br/>
I growl, I whoof, I circle round and whine<br/>
because a wolf can scratch just only past<br/>
his ribs, yet to this fate he won&apos;t resign.<br/>
Who answers howls, who&apos;s there to call upon?<br/>
Or should I wait in silence for the dawn?</div></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Darkness Fills the Shade</div><div class="sonnetSeries">While sitting under sighing shade I shake.<br/>
With darkness silence falls like heavy weight.<br/>
These itching sheaves are keeping me awake.<br/>
I know the dawn won&apos;t come but still I wait.<br/>
But then a beacon blazes through the sky.<br/>
My pointed snout and ghoulish eyes now turn<br/>
to find a flare, a prayer I now supply.<br/>
And so I run to see how it could burn.<br/>
My preying gallop strains and yearns with heart.<br/>
The canine grunts which fill my pointy ears<br/>
won&apos;t daunt my dogged drive or keep apart<br/>
that lively light from hide and fangs of fears.<br/>
But then the light begins to falter, fade.<br/>
And once again the darkness fills the shade.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Whisper</div><div class="sonnetSeries">With matted hair I&apos;d never be at ease,<br/>
much less the ones I&apos;ve left at home would be,<br/>
but sighing trees now whisper with the breeze,<br/>
perhaps for wolves consoling company.<br/>
My ears can hear the apprehensive winds,<br/>
and soon I see no consolation here.<br/>
For who can bear but some with mournful friends<br/>
who ghostly whistle famine, war, and fear?<br/>
But still I wished their lengthy limbs would bend<br/>
and condescend to wrap me in their arms.<br/>
For then with entish love my heart they&apos;d mend<br/>
while keeping safe from claws and wolfish harms.<br/>
But could I ever feel a warming touch of love<br/>
when sheaves I shoulder crush me from above?</div></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Stranger</div><div class="sonnetSeries">While sniffing through the earthy leaves and soil,<br/>
a shaggy dog tail wagging left and right,<br/>
I hear a noise like one in love will toil<br/>
with pebbles and a window in the night.<br/>
This wolfish hide begins to beat like drums,<br/>
its preying posture centers on the sound,<br/>
its leather lips reveal strong fangs and gums,<br/>
its lanky legs rear back and circle round.<br/>
I catch another tap, a crack, and then<br/>
a steady, shuffling shush of leaf march tread.<br/>
I lower furrowed brow and sharpened chin<br/>
and growl in case this stranger wants me dead.<br/>
At last I glimpse the stranger&apos;s shadowed face<br/>
the sweat, the sanguine eyes were full of chase.</div>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Hunter</div><div class="sonnetSeries">I&apos;m flying through the forest as his prey<br/>
while trees jump up as though they&apos;re in a dance.<br/>
These sheaves, this hunter make me dream of day,<br/>
but hope is cut as with a surgeon&apos;s lance.<br/>
My reverie is broken by a plunge<br/>
into an icy river which begins to prod<br/>
my memory of thoughts I can&apos;t expunge.<br/>
For wolves are shameful killers where they trod.<br/>
Emerging on the other bank I turn<br/>
and looking down upon the water see<br/>
a wolf&apos;s reflection, one deserving spurn,<br/>
and up I see the hunter I would flee.<br/>
What sort of man could hunt a wolf so well<br/>
through woods as frigid, biting, dark as hell?</div></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Stigma Fills His Hands</div><div class="sonnetSeries">A jagged cliff has caged me in the bank<br/>
and now my hunter captivates my gaze.<br/>
Despite the panting fog of dog breath rank,<br/>
these eyes review his features in the haze.<br/>
Though garbed in heavy coat and pants and boots,<br/>
my hunter carries neither gun nor snare.<br/>
A kinder purpose still this wolf refutes,<br/>
despite the healing warmth within his stare.<br/>
He marches undeterred through water cold<br/>
like geese that paddle calmly over ponds,<br/>
his hands are muddy, thick from work untold<br/>
like those that know the weight of heavy bonds.<br/>
Though he draws near I&apos;m still yet petrified.<br/>
He wears the stigma of the crucified.</div>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Wolf's Fame</div><div class="sonnetSeries">The hunter stretching out his hands steps out<br/>
onto the bank walking closer, nearer still.<br/>
His wounded hands seemed reaching for my snout<br/>
which gritted, grimaced warning that I&apos;d kill.<br/>
His eyes were beckoning through groans and growls,<br/>
but thoughts his mighty hands could strangle me<br/>
evoked a fiendish lunge into his bowels,<br/>
so mine is fame a wolf would wish to see.<br/>
The hunter stumbled back onto the ground<br/>
groaning, grunting, heaving; silence fell.<br/>
And rolling off him I with sheaves am bound,<br/>
for wolfish fame is shame befitting hell.<br/>
In fame and solitude I am disgraced.<br/>
But O how much I wish to be embraced!</div></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-10 desktopMargin"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">The Friend of Wolves</div><div class="sonnetSeries">The stream of blood went forward, backward, back<br/>
into the hunter whom I&apos;d slain in fear.<br/>
The misty air then followed, finding track<br/>
into his lungs, O might I shed a tear!<br/>
But wolves won&apos;t weep for want of teary eyes,<br/>
yet still that man I&apos;d killed arose to life.<br/>
He rose and chuckled, feeding my surprise<br/>
and bid me come to him to heal my strife.<br/>
With pierced hands he loosed my sheaves of shame;<br/>
then firmly placing palms on either side<br/>
of me, he drew me in and breathed my name,<br/>
removing shame and melting wolfish hide.<br/>
Dear Jesus, friend of wolves, will always find<br/>
all those who stray and them their hope remind.</div>
