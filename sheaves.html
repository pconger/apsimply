For I'd become a hide of filthy fur,<br/>
a mouth of fearful fangs, a wolf for some,<br/>
a fearsome, horrid phantom all concur.<br/>
So now I scamper, stirring fallen leaves.<br/>
The lonesome moonlight guides me as I trace<br/>
through tree trunk traps and shoulder sheaves<br/>
upon my grizzled back with sore disgrace.<br/>
These sheaves of shame are strapped around me fast.<br/>
I growl, I whoof, I circle round and whine<br/>
because a wolf can scratch just only past<br/>
his ribs, yet to this fate he won't resign.<br/>
Who answers howls, who's there to call upon?<br/>
Or should I wait in silence for the dawn?</div></div>
    <div class="col-5 desktopMarginRight"><div class="sonnetSeriesTitle">Darkness Fills the Shade</div><div class="sonnetSeries">While sitting under sighing shade I shake.<br/>
With darkness silence falls like heavy weight.<br/>
These itching sheaves are keeping me awake.<br/>
I know the dawn won't come but still I wait.<br/>
But then a beacon blazes through the sky.<br/>
My pointed snout and ghoulish eyes now turn<br/>
to find a flare, a prayer I now supply.<br/>
And so I run to see how it could burn.<br/>
My preying gallop strains and yearns with heart.<br/>
The canine grunts which fill my pointy ears<br/>
won't daunt my dogged drive or keep apart<br/>
that lively light from hide and fangs of fears.<br/>
But then the light begins to falter, fade.<br/>
And once again the darkness fills the shade.</div>
