    <p>Traveling has always been a struggle for me. On the one hand, I have a strong desire to see the world, experience new places and cultures, and expand my horizons. On the other, I have a strong desire to save money and to eliminate excess. Even though traveling is often seen as a luxury and an activity for the wealthy, I believe that it actually is essential to our continued education and can be an activity even for those on a tight budget.</p>

    <p>Just this past weekend, our family took a trip to Montreal in the Quebec province of Canada. We set a budget of $500 for the trip and spent $434 - $116 for accommodations and $318 for everything else (gas, groceries, restaurants, and entertainment). Our trip was Thursday through Sunday. We had two days that primarily consisted of driving and two full days to explore the area. All meals, with the exception of breakfast on Thursday, were eaten on the road.</p>

    <p>Here are some things we focused on to stick to our budget and maintain our goal of simple living:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Choose to drive over fly when possible. Being on the open road always brings perspective and allows you to see the countryside as someone might who lives in the area. It takes longer, sure, but it also means singing out loud in the car, long conversations, picnics at rest areas, unexpected sights, and generally just more memories than are created in airports.</li>
    <li>Only eat out once a day, but do eat out! Food is a great way to experience local culture, but you don&rsquo;t have to eat out at every meal to experience the best of it. Go grocery shopping when you first arrive and buy food for breakfast and lunch (or dinner if you prefer). This trip we chose to take the mornings slow and make a big breakfast of eggs, bacon, oatmeal, toast, and sparkling orange juice. We got a loaf of bread and peanut butter to have for lunch one day, granola bars, and some fruit. We were still able to try the food that Montreal is famous for - poutine, smoked meat, bagels - while not breaking the bank.</li>
    <li>Stay somewhere inexpensive! I mean, how much time do you actually spend in your room while vacationing? We love Airbnb because we can choose a place with a kitchen and any other specific amenities we are looking for at a (usually) very inexpensive price.</li>
    <li>Choose to walk whenever possible or take public transportation. Walking allows you to see all the sites in between your destinations and get a feel for the place as a whole. We chose to walk across the Pont Jacques Cartier, the loooong bridge across the St. Lawrence River, instead of taking the metro or driving because it allowed us to see the skyline and take in the beauty of the river. Public transportation allows you to experience what it might be like to live in the city, getting from place to place or commuting to work.</li>
    <li>Do your research before you go. Learn a little of the language. Find out what events are taking place while you&rsquo;re there. Know what are must-see places and what you don&rsquo;t need to waste a $20 entrance fee to see. While riding the ferris wheel, flying down the zipline, or doing similar touristy things might be tempting activities, experiencing the <em>culture</em> of a place is always our goal.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Travel and simple living do not have to be at odds. While we certainly did not see or try everything while in Montreal, we were able to experience a little of the culture and open our eyes to a new part of the world!</p>
