<div class="blogPostTitle">October 28, 2017 - Fall Fun</div>

<div class="row">

<div class="blogPost">We decided to get into the fall mood by going out to buy pumpkins and paints.  We came back and had fun painting the pumpkins.  We decided to go with a family theme - since we're expecting!  I couldn't help but make my "DAD" pumpkin massive.  Checkout the video!  We posted it to let the masses know that we're expecting.</div>

<div class="blogPost">We hope to keep you informed about our activites.  We are a self-hosted site (one of my random experiments), so as we continue to add blog entries, you may also see the site's design become more sophisticated.  Love, Preston.</div>
