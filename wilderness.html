  In silence I have sat beside your bed,<br/>
but now I beg your sleeping body rise<br/>
and quit the dark horizon of the dead,<br/>
and harmonize the chords of my reprise.<br/>

I pray my whispered breaths won&apos;t go amiss.<br/>
For here I have to trust my whispered breath<br/>
to steal you back and save you from your death.
