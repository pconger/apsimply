<div>We decided to get into the fall mood by going out to buy pumpkins and paints.  We came back and had fun painting the pumpkins.  We decided to go with a family theme - since we're expecting!  I couldn't help but make my "DAD" pumpkin massive.  Checkout the video!  We posted it to let the masses know that we're expecting.</div>
